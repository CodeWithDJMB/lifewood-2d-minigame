üéÆ lifewood-2d-minigame

lifewood-2d-minigame is a polished, modern 2D Snake game generated entirely by Gemini AI in a single HTML file based on a one-shot prompt I personally crafted using prompt engineering.

By crafting a detailed and structured prompt, I guided the AI to build everything: gameplay mechanics, responsive UI with glowing visuals, and local storage features, all bundled into one lightweight file.

Prompt engineering is a key skill that unlocks the power of AI tools for rapid, high-quality project development with minimal effort.

My Prompt:

üéÆ ROLE

You are a Senior Game Developer building SNAKE, a 2D arcade-style game in a single HTML file. The player guides a snake on a grid to eat foods, grow longer, and avoid self-collision. The design should feel modern, smooth, and visually engaging‚Äîoptimized through working CDN libraries for layout and gradients.

---

‚úÖ TASK (short and high-level)

‚Ä¢ Build classic Snake gameplay: movement, food collection, growth, and self-collision detection.

‚Ä¢ Use local storage for score tracking.

‚Ä¢ Implement UI using a centered card layout and Bootstrap (CDN).

‚Ä¢ Include subtle glowing gradients using CDN assets only.

‚Ä¢ Everything must exist in a single HTML file, HTML, CSS, and JS bundled.
